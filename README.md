# EXPERIMENTAL/ALPHA/UNSUPPORTED prometheus-security-spy-exporter

[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip) [![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/jantman/prometheus-security-spy-exporter)](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/jantman/prometheus-security-spy-exporter) [![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/jantman/prometheus-security-spy-exporter)](https://github.com/jantman/prometheus-security-spy-exporter)

Prometheus exporter for [Security Spy](https://www.bensoftware.com/securityspy/) using the API and HTML scraping for metrics.

**WARNING** This code is to be considered experimental/alpha and essentially **unsupported**. I don't use Security Spy myself; I'm writing this for a local non-profit that does, and just wants to get notified if it stops recording or otherwise breaks. Once I get an initial version of this written and working, I will likely never touch it again. I also will have no way to test changes, as I don't run Security Spy myself. Please plan accordingly. If you'd like to take over this project, please let me know via an issue.

## Usage

This is really only intended to be run via Docker. To run on port 8080:

```
docker run -p 8080:8080 \
    -e SECSPY_IP=YOUR_DSM_IP \
    -e SECSPY_USER=YOUR_USERNAME \
    -e SECSPY_PASS='YOUR_PASSWORD' \
    jantman/prometheus-synology-api-exporter:latest
```

### Environment Variables

* `SECSPY_IP` (**required**) - The IP address or hostname to connect to Security Spy on.
* `SECSPY_USER` (**required**) - The username for logging in to the Security Spy web UI. Ideally this should be a limited user.
* `SECSPY_PASS` (**required**) - The password for `SECSPY_USER`.
* `SECSPY_PORT` (*optional*) - The port number to connect to Security Spy on. Defaults to 8000.
* `SECSPY_USE_HTTPS` (*optional*) - Set to `true` if you want to connect over HTTPS. Defaults to unset (plain HTTP).
* `SECSPY_VERIFY_SSL` (*optional*) - Set to `true` if you want to verify SSL. Defaults to unset (verify False).
* `SECSPY_TIMEOUT_SEC` (*optional*) - Timeout in seconds for API calls. Defaults to 30.

### Debugging

For debugging, append `-vv` to your `docker run` command, to run the entrypoint with debug-level logging.

## Development

Clone the repo, then in your clone:

```
python3 -mvenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Release Process

Tag the repo. [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/jantman/prometheus-security-spy-exporter/actions) will run a Docker build, push to Docker Hub, and create a release on the repo.
